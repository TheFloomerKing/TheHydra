Coordination mechanisms of the American public sector

This is a collaborative book to explain and illustrate the many ways
in which the public sector in America feeds and reinforces itself.
It is empirical; no new theoretical ground is broken, nor are
controversial or obscure facts needed to make the case.

The apolitical lay reader, or "normie", should be able to read this
and understand why universities, bureaucracies, courts, media, and
entertainment all seem to move in unison, with the effect of serving
one ideology.  He should learn why that ideology is inevitably 
hostile to tradition, wealth, religion, family, and beauty.

The same reader should not be asked to share the authors' every cause.
The book should be interesting regardless of the political view
with which it is approached; which is not to say we don't hope
that view will come to more resemble our own.
